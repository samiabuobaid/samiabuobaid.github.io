    <h1> Baseball Playing Fields in Pittsburgh </h1>
    <br><br>
    <div>
    <p>
        There are over a hundred baseball fields within Pittsburgh, all with varying dimensions, or multi-sport capacities. What is interesting is the neighborhood locations of the fields
      as well as the frequency in each neighborhood. The graphic below illustrates how many playing fields are in each neighborhood. After organizing and graphing the data,
      17 neighborhoods had three or more playing fields, 11 had two playing fields, and 17 had one playing field.

      If you want to get a definite answer while using the "Number of Playing Fields per Neighborhood" graph, simply trace the black line that 
      caps the blue area on the graph to receive (Neighborhood, # of Fields).

        In order to visualize the exact location of where the fields are, below is a map that pins where the fields are located. It was no surprise that 
        Downtown Pittsburgh had no playing fields, as there is not space to accomadate for it.
