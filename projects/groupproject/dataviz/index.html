        <hr>
        <p>
		With a seemingly endless amount of food establishments in Allegheny County, it may be difficult to keep track of restaurants and pricing. 
		As an attempt to simplify the problem, we have gathered data on over 600 restaurants, relating to prices, rating, location, review counts as well as the food genre. 
		Hopefully, the accumulation of the data will help many find a restaurant that fits their prices and desires. 
        </p>
		
		<p>
		Before we begin, there are few things to note about the data gathered from Yelp. 
		Regarding pricing, Yelp uses four different ratings including $, $$, $$$, $$$$. 
		It may seem a little confusing as to what exactly is the pricing range for symbols, but it goes as follows:
		</p>
		
		<ul style="align:center">
			<li>$: $1-$10</li>
			<li>$$: $11-$30</li>
			<li>$$$: $31-$60</li>
			<li>$$$$: $61+</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>
		After getting a definite price range for the $ symbols and yelps price rating, it’s time to talk about reviews and average rating. 
		Sure, a 4 or 5 star review looks really nice, but it’s important to note the amount of ratings that carry into the review. 
		A 4 star rating on a restaurant that has been rated 267 times is more trustworthy than a 4 star rating on a restaurant that has been rated 79 times. 
		It isn’t a strict rule to follow, but more as a guideline when trying to find places to eat. 
		At the end of the day, whenever it comes to rating a restaurant, it is on the consumer to find out for themselves whether or not they like the experience or food of any restaurant. 
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Another thing to note is that Allegheny County has a total area of 745 square miles, so not every restaurant grants consumers the ability to travel or eat out. 
		However, sometimes people feel adventurous or some have to commute to work, so many options are mapped. 
		Even though Yelp is a great tool for restaurants, it is worthy to mention any reviews are based on opinion, so a bad review might not be the death blow to a night out.
		</p>

		<h2> Food Genres </h2>
		<br>
		<p>
		New American - A label given to a restaurant that features foods from many different regions and ethnicities. 
		New American oftentimes is the label given to show what the restaurant isn’t. A restaurant might feature pasta but isn’t Italian. 
		It might also have sushi on the menu but not be considered Japanese. A New American restaurant a place that offers reflect America’s “melting pot status” through its food.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Traditional American - This category is apt at describing the food that the restaurants offer. 
		Traditional American covers food that is mixed with other regional cuisines but have a significant identity. 
		A great example would be apple pie or philly cheese steak sandwich. Usually it is a mix of steak dishes, burgers and sandwiches, as well as seafood.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Culture Food - We had a large variety of restaurants that are defined by ethnicity and the restaurants are categorized as such. 
		The list of ethnic food is below:
		</p>
		
		<ul style="align:center">
			<li>Argentine</li>
			<li>Brazilian</li>
			<li>Caribbean</li>
			<li>Greek</li>
			<li>Italian</li>
			<li>Korean</li>		
			<li>Latin</li>
			<li>Mediterranean</li>
			<li>Mexican</li>
			<li>Polish</li>
			<li>Thai</li>
			<li>Vietnamese</li>
		</ul>
