      Of the 327 players, coaches, executives, and contributors that reside in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, 9 of them are from countries out side the United States of America.
      It is important to note that because I have compiled the birthplaces of all of the American Hall of Famers into data visualizations.

      The visualizations include one histogram and two maps, all of which were created using Tableau Public. I am very interested in sports, and my love for
      the Pittsburgh Steelers made me want to track where all of the Hall of Famers have come from.
