      This here will be the main content of the github pages, as I intend to explain my project and why I chose it. I am keeping it simple for now with the first 10 hours, since I can polish it in the second 10 hours.

    <p> This text is here to show where the potential explanation of the visualizations will go. The idea is to have the visualization fill the main 
      content while the sidebar assists the user in clarity, or other interesting tidbits.
